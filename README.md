Thanks for visiting my github repository! Here you can download the NSIS scripts, and the VB source files. This was built in Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, so make sure you've downloaded and installed that. Thanks! (please ignore the structure of this repo, i made this when i had no idea how github worked lol)

TO RUN:
Download the installer from the NSIS directory and run it - ignore the windows smartscreen error, or download the solution files and open in Visual Studio 2017.
