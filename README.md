This GitHub Repository contains Visual Studio 2017 solutions, which you can download, edit, and submit any changes to me at 
ctech9suggestions@gmail.com. I can also send you a beta if I am in the process of making one. If you want the setup executable, go to drummer1074.wixsite.com/codingwithchris-1.
